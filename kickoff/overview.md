# Transformative Tech Teach In Kickoff!

We are so excited to get to know you and welcome you into this program during our kickoff meeting on Thursday, May 6 from 4-5:30pm. We've heard that this might be slightly too late for some folks so we will make sure that future events happen earlier in the day!

## Pre-work

There are a few short pieces of pre-work that we ask you to complete before you join us for the kick-off. If youâ€™re unable to join the kickoff, we highly recommend still completing these as they will help you understand and engage with our discussions in the future.

- [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWP92i7JLlQ) about the idea of intersectionality. 
- [Fill out this identity wheel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15GjuamanM0sXI-NtOTWTbcGJpOR7M4Mx/view) and consider your answers to the reflection questions. You will not be asked to share those answers if you don't feel comfortable.

## Optional Further Resources
- [Listen to this interview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FE7Bf6IfALOUUKRTzjh6KhCGw0H3Yf2w/view) with the Founder of Ada, Scott Case, to hear about how Ada was created some of the blindspots the founders realized they had.
