# Gender Identity & Expression in the Workplace

June kicks of Pride Month which is celebrated each year in honor of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in Manhattan, New York, The Stonewall Uprising was a tipping point for the Gay Liberation Movement in the United States. This month is to recognize the impact that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non binary, and queer folks have had on history locally, nationally, and internationally. 

There would be no pride month without the advocacy of Black queer activists. Please read more about the history of pride and Black queer activism here: [First Pride Riot History](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9861317/first-pride-riots-history-black-lgbtq-blm)
