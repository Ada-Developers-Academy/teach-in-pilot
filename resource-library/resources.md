# Resource Library

Here are some additional, optional resources for you to engage with around the different topics we will cover. Feel free to share thoughts and reflections from these in our Slack channel! 

## Ada History
- [Listen to this interview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FE7Bf6IfALOUUKRTzjh6KhCGw0H3Yf2w/view) with the Founder of Ada, Scott Case, to hear about how Ada Developers Academy got off the ground and who the founders neglected to consider at its origin.

## Systemic Racism & Intersectionality
- [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWP92i7JLlQ) on intersectionality featuring Kimberlé W. Crenshaw. Crenshaw’s work has been foundational in critical race theory and in “intersectionality,” a term she coined to describe the double bind of simultaneous racial and gender prejudice. 
- [Fill out this identity wheel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15GjuamanM0sXI-NtOTWTbcGJpOR7M4Mx/view) and consider your answers to the reflection questions. You will not be asked to share those answers if you don't feel comfortable.
- Read [this article, "In Her Words"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KfOOB0238j9VOesOXkE8v4o9Ki0dCVT0/view), about systemic racism in the workplace.
- [Read about the levels of racism](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Az4mFd1KbhX4Etau7vfuIhSw2qUEEAsF/view) and how racism comes up internally, interpersonally, institutionally, and structurally.
- [Read "Stop Telling Women They Have Impostor Syndrome"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jNOukGPSvcM9NT7h1_F1mNL1CcM1nytQ/view), a great article that reflects our first live session.
