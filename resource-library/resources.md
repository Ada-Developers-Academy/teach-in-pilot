## Systemic Racism & Intersectionality
- [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWP92i7JLlQ) on intersectionality featuring Kimberlé W. Crenshaw. Crenshaw’s work has been foundational in critical race theory and in “intersectionality,” a term she coined to describe the double bind of simultaneous racial and gender prejudice.
